# 3X3 LED Tic-Tac-Toe AI

This project is a 3 by 3 RGB LED matrix tic-tac-toe game that is design for a user to play against as AI opponent.

# Files

The project folder is split into two folders: one for the electrical schematic of the Arduino shield, and the other is for the Arduino code.
The code is further split into two more files on specifically for the Arduino code and the other is the same code but written using PlatformIO.

### Next Steps
The next step for this project would be create more games for the 3 by 3 board layout.
ex. Hexapawn.
